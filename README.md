# NERVOX

### This is a work in progress!
*Nervox* is a lightweight wrapper around TensorFlow, a widely used machine learning framework. The primary value proposition for *Nervox* is to provide a joyful development experience to ML scientists, by providing an intuitive and coherent abstraction on top of the tensorflow core API. *Nervox* exposes a thin but versatile interface for enabling end-to-end machine learning activities, with a focus on bringing transparency and reproducibility to the underlying workflows and experiments.

*Nervox* provides a comprehensive set of tools and features, including, standardized workflows for implementing training and evaluation protocols, automatic parametrization of the components, tracking and logging of ML pursuits/tasks, a repository of pre-trained models, protocols and datasets together with a wide range of customization options. The compatibility with the TensorFlow ecosystem ensures that it can continue to play a valuable role in the wider machine learning community.
