# NERVOX

### This is a work in progress!
*Nervox* is a lightweight wrapper around TensorFlow, a widely used machine learning framework. The primary value proposition for *Nervox* is to provide a joyful development experience to ML scientists. *Nervox* provides a trasparent and intuitive abstraction on top of tensorflow core API. It exposes a thin but versatile interface for carrying out end-to-end machine learning activities, with a focus on bringing transparency and reproducibility to the underlying workflows and experiments.

To achieve this, *Nervox* provides a comprehensive set of tools and features, including, standardized workflows for implementing training and evaluation protocols, automatic parametrization of the components, tracking and logging of ML pursuits, a repository of pre-trained models, protocols and datasets together with a wide range of customization options. The compatibility with the TensorFlow ecosystem ensures that it can continue to play a valuable role in the wider machine learning community.

Overall, *Nervox* is an invaluable tool for developers looking to streamline their machine learning workflows. Its intuitive interface, lightweight design and seamless integration with TensorFlow make it a great choice for a wide range of use cases, from simple prototypes to large-scale, production-ready applications.
