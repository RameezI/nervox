# NERVOX

### This is a work in progress!
*Nervox* is a lightweight wrapper around TensorFlow, a widely used machine learning framework. Nervox aims to elevate the development experience for ML scientists by offering a clear and intuitive abstraction over the TensorFlow core API. With its streamlined yet flexible interface, Nervox supports comprehensive machine learning workflows, prioritizing transparency and reproducibility in every experiment.

*Nervox* provides a rich set of tools and features, including, standardized workflows for implementing training and evaluation protocols, automatic parametrization of the components, tracking and logging of ML pursuits, a repository of pre-trained models, and validated training protocols together with a wide range of customization options. The compatibility with the TensorFlow ecosystem ensures that it can continue to play a valuable role in the wider machine learning community.
