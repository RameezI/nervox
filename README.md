*Nervox* is a lightweight wrapper around TensorFlow, a widely used machine learning framework. Nervox offers a clear and intuitive abstraction over the TensorFlow core API. 

*Nervox* provides tools and features, including, standardized workflows for implementing training and evaluation protocols, automatic parametrization of the components, tracking and logging of ML pursuits, a repository of pre-trained model.
